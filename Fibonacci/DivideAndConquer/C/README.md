# Nth [fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) algorithm in C programming language using divide and conquer technique

##  Files:
* fib.c:       Contains fib function's code
* fib.h:       Contains decleration of fib function
* fib_test.c:  fib function test program
* runtest:     Bash script for compiling and runing test

## Runing test
You need to have gcc compiler and bash interpreter installed on your machine in order to run the test.

For running the test you have to execute ./runtest script from your command line:
```Bash
$ ./runtest 30
```
The optional argument to ./runtest determines the nth fibonacci number to find (The default is: 30)

The output shows the algorithm's execution time in seconds.
