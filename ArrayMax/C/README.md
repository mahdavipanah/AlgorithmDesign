# Finding the max number in an array using divide and conquer technique in C programming language

##  Files:
* arraymax.c:       Contains array_max function's code
* arraymax.h:       Contains decleration of array_max function
* arraymax_test.c:  array_max function test program
* runtest:     Bash script for compiling and runing test

## Runing test
You need to have gcc compiler and bash interpreter installed on your machine in order to run the test.

For running the test you have to execute ./runtest script from your command line:
```Bash
$ ./runtest 10000
```
The optional argument to ./runtest determines the size of array to run the max algorithm on. (The default is: 10000)

The output shows if the test has been successful and the algorithm's execution time in seconds.
